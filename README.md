# Jeromche's Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, managed with Stow.

Instructions can be found here: http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html?round=two

## In short

    1. Move the dotfiles to subdirectories of `~/dotfiles` with the directory structure in tact.
    2. Go to `~/dotfiles` and run `$ stow [package name]`.
